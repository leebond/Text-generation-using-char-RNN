# Description
Word character generation using RNN

## Model training
You can train the model with the training script. It will take roughly 10 mins to run on a local machine.
1. run model-Training-charRNN.py

## Model testing
I have pretrained a model in ./model directory. The script below will call the model file from that folder
2. run model-Testing-charRNN.py
