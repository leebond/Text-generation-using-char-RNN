La présente garantie limitée est nulle si la défectuosité du Logiciel est causée par un accident, un usage abusif, une mauvaise application, un usage anormal ou un virus. Tout Logiciel de remplacement sera garanti pour le reste de la période initiale de la garantie ou pendant trente (30) jours, selon la plus longue entre ces deux périodes. À l’extérieur des États-Unis ou du Canada, ces recours ou l’un quelconque des services de soutien technique offerts par Microsoft ne sont pas disponibles sans preuve d’achat d’une source internationale autorisée.
